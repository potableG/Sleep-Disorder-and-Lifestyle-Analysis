# Sleep Disorder Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a **Sleep Disorder Data Analysis Dashboard** designed to visualize key metrics related to sleep disorders and their impact on various factors such as **physical activity, stress levels, BMI, and heart rate**. The dashboard provides interactive insights to help understand sleep patterns across different demographics.



## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on individuals' sleep disorders, gender, BMI categories, occupations, physical activity levels, heart rate, stress levels, and sleep duration.

## Key Metrics and Insights
### 1. **Summary Statistics**
- **Total Participants**: 374
- **Average Sleep Quality**: 7
- **Average Sleep Duration**: 7 hours
- **Average Physical Activity Level**: 59
- **Average Daily Steps**: 7K
- **Average Heart Rate**: 70 bpm

### 2. **Sleep Disorder Distribution**
- Majority of individuals (219) reported **no sleep disorder**.
- 78 individuals suffer from **Sleep Apnea**.
- 77 individuals have **Insomnia**.

### 3. **Demographic Breakdown**
- **Gender Distribution**:
  - Female: 185
  - Male: 189
- **BMI Distribution**:
  - Normal Weight: 216
  - Overweight: 148
  - Obese: 10
- **Occupation Distribution**:
  - Nurse: 73
  - Doctor: 71
  - Engineer: 63
  - Lawyer: 47
  - Teacher: 40

### 4. **Physical Activity & Steps by Sleep Disorder**
- Individuals **without sleep disorders** take significantly more steps (~12,631) compared to those with **Sleep Apnea (5,834 steps)** and **Insomnia (3,605 steps)**.
- The average step count per day is 7K, indicating a variation based on sleep disorder status.

### 5. **Heart Rate by Sleep Disorder**
- **Sleep Apnea** patients have the highest heart rate (73 bpm), followed by **Insomnia (70 bpm)** and **None (69 bpm)**.

### 6. **Quality of Sleep by Sleep Disorder**
- Individuals **without sleep disorders** reported the highest sleep quality scores (1,670).
- Those with **Sleep Apnea** (562) and **Insomnia** (503) reported lower sleep quality.

### 7. **Stress Level by Sleep Disorder**
- Stress levels are evenly distributed among individuals with and without sleep disorders.

### 8. **Age by Sleep Disorder**
- Average age of individuals with **Sleep Apnea**: 50
- Average age of individuals with **Insomnia**: 44
- Average age of individuals without sleep disorders: 39

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel / SQL**: Possible data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Python / Pandas**: Potential data analysis and manipulation.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Filter Options**: Use the **Gender, BMI Category, and Sleep Disorder filters** to customize the visualization.
2. **Hover Over Charts**: Gain deeper insights by hovering over graphs for more details.
3. **Interpret Insights**: Identify trends and patterns in sleep disorders and their effects on various health factors.

## Insights & Recommendations
- **Physical Activity & Sleep**: Higher physical activity and daily steps correlate with better sleep quality.
- **Heart Rate & Sleep Disorders**: Sleep disorders may contribute to increased heart rates, emphasizing the importance of monitoring cardiovascular health.
- **Work & Sleep Patterns**: Certain occupations (e.g., doctors and nurses) might experience higher risks of sleep disorders due to shift work.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Machine Learning**: Predictive models to assess sleep disorder risks.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Correlation analysis between multiple variables.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Incorporate live data feeds for real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sleep disorders and their impact on various health metrics. By visualizing these key insights, the project aims to improve awareness and inform better sleep management strategies.
